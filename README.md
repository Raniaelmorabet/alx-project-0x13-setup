# HookMastery: Unleashing the Power of Hooks

## 🛠️ Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage state effectively in Next.js applications. Participants were tasked with creating a dynamic Image Generation App with modular components and reusable interfaces.

---

## 🌟 Importance
- **State Management**: Learn and apply `useState` for tracking application state dynamically.
- **Component Reusability**: Build modular components like `Header`, `Footer`, and `ImageCard`.
- **Next.js Framework**: Explore Next.js to structure scalable React applications.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Enable real-time updates based on user inputs and actions.

---

## 🧩 Key Tasks
1. **App Creation**: Set up a Next.js project and define components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Layout`).
2. **State Implementation**: Use `useState` to manage prompt input, image generation, and loading states.
3. **Reusable Interfaces**: Define interfaces in `TypeScript` for better type safety.
4. **ImageCard Component**: Build an interactive image display component with dynamic props.
5. **Dynamic User Interaction**: Enable users to input prompts and visualize generated images.
